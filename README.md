# DRAGON DICE GAME
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/1jna3x-qV5s>
#### Description: 
In the Dragon Dice Game, the player and the computer play turn after turn with a six-sided dice where the player tries to win by scoring 60 points before the computer 
through following rules and mechanics that include penalties and bonuses such as the player losing half of his total score if the die rolls a 3 and getting an additional penalty
of 1 point at the end of every round regardless of his performance, while the computer has benefits such as receiving double points whenever it rolls an even number and getting 
an extra turn whenever it rolls a 6, and the game plays out by turns until either of the participants gets or exceeds the target score of 60 points and then declares the first 
participant to achieve this as the winner, providing an interesting mix of chance and strategy that challenges both participants to adapt to the dynamic outcomes of their dice rolls.


# UPDATED DRAGON DICE GAME

#### Description:
This code implements a simple dice betting game between the player and the computer. The player places a bet either on ‘Player’ or ‘Computer’ and they take turns in rolling two dice. Each time a player rolls their dice, they should win the game by scoring a certain amount of points-1-30 points in this case. There is also a betting rule that allows the player to either win or lose a bet depending on who they placed their bet on. Each time a player wins a match, the following results which encompass all the details about the match hint’s username, winning and the loser, the side where the bet was placed and the amount are all recorded in a CSV file for future references. Through out the game, the player is free to either quit or restart the game. Each time they would do so, the graphical interface changes accordingly. This Python script provides a GUI based dice game on `tkinter`, in which the player competes against the computer by throwing die and betting who will win. The winner is the player who achieves 30 points first, and if the player's bet is correct, that player's bet is doubled-the results saved in a CSV file, to which the player can access anytime for quitting or restarting the game. The first step in the game is to have the player enter their username and bet. Next, the player and the computer alternately roll the dice, while keeping track of their rolling points: if one of them reaches a score of 30, the play ends, and that player will be announced as the winner. If the score is the right one, a double bet will be placed and all results of the game will be filled in a CSV file. Players can quit the game, which has then caused a disabling of the "Quit" button, or restart the game, which clears scores and puts the game in another round. The code also includes unit tests with `pytest` for testing the functionality of the game, so it behaves as needed. Thus, the code serves to an interactive dice game in which betting scores are tracked and results are saved to allow for the complete experience.
