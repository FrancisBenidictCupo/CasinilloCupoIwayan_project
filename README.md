# DRAGON DICE GAME
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/1jna3x-qV5s>
#### Description: 
In the Dragon Dice Game, the player and the computer play turn after turn with a six-sided dice where the player tries to win by scoring 60 points before the computer 
through following rules and mechanics that include penalties and bonuses such as the player losing half of his total score if the die rolls a 3 and getting an additional penalty
of 1 point at the end of every round regardless of his performance, while the computer has benefits such as receiving double points whenever it rolls an even number and getting 
an extra turn whenever it rolls a 6, and the game plays out by turns until either of the participants gets or exceeds the target score of 60 points and then declares the first 
participant to achieve this as the winner, providing an interesting mix of chance and strategy that challenges both participants to adapt to the dynamic outcomes of their dice rolls.
